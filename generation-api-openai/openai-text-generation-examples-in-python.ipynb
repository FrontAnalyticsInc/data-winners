      "\n",
      "1. Suspension Maintenance: Regularly check and lubricate the suspension pivots and seals to keep them functioning properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Brake Bleeding: For hydraulic disc brakes, it is important to bleed the system every 6-12 months to remove any air bubbles and ensure optimal braking performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Wheel Truing: Use a spoke tension meter to ensure equal tension on all spokes and prevent wheel wobbling. It is also important to check the wheel for any dents or damage that could affect its strength and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Drivetrain Cleaning: Use a degreaser and a brush to thoroughly clean the chain, cassette, and chainrings. This will not only improve shifting performance but also prolong the life of these components.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Bottom Bracket Overhaul: Every 1-2 years, remove and clean the bottom bracket, replacing any worn bearings or seals. This will keep the pedals spinning smoothly and prevent any potential damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Headset Adjustment: Check and adjust the headset bearings to ensure smooth steering and prevent any play or stiffness in the handlebars.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Tubeless Tire Maintenance: For tubeless tires, periodically check the sealant levels and top up as needed. Also, clean and inspect the rim tape to ensure a proper seal and prevent air leaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Frame Protection: Use protective tape or film to cover high-wear areas on the frame, such as the chainstays and downtube, to prevent scratches and chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Carbon Fiber Care: For bikes with carbon fiber frames, regularly check for any cracks or damage and use a carbon-specific cleaner and polish to maintain the appearance and strength of the frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Electronic Shifting Diagnostics: If your bike has electronic shifting, learn how to use the diagnostic tools and software provided by the manufacturer to troubleshoot any issues and ensure proper functioning.\n"
